<!-- All unnamed code blocks will take the language -->
<!-- of the 'code-lang' metadata field. -->
`fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()>`

<!-- Code already annotated with a class is unaffected -->
`y <- 1:10`{.r}

```{r}

1:10

```

<!-- since 'none' is not a valid language -->
<!-- this block will not be highlighted -->
```none
This is some raw text.
No formatting in this block.
